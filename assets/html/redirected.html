        <p><em>This post originally appeared in the BI Today newsletter. You can sign up for Business Insider's daily newsletter <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/subscription">here</a>.</em></p>

        <p>Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. The job market continues to evolve rapidly, and today we're focusing on how professionals are adapting their networking strategies in 2025.</p>

        <h3>Networking enters a new era</h3>
        
        <p>For job seekers, there's a saying that's been around for as long as I can remember: "It's not what you know, it's who you know." That mantra is perhaps more important now than ever.</p>
        
        <p>Recruiters and career coaches say professional networking is even more imperative in this economy, where companies are flattening management layers and becoming more discerning about who they hire. Research also shows that companies are hiring fewer people in roles that AI can do :cite[1].</p>
        
        <p>Friday's jobs report showed the winners and losers of the workforce are increasingly coming into focus. Roles in healthcare and service work are still growing, whereas the white-collar workforce and new grads looking for work are struggling.</p>
        
        <p>In this market, one way for job seekers to get ahead is to build genuine relationships that can help them stand out in competitive hiring processes.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "You've got more reasons to treat networking like healthy eating or hitting the gym ‚Äî and not something you do only in January," says BI's workplace reporter Tim Paradis.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>The dos and don'ts of networking in 2025</h3>
        
        <p>BI's Alice Tecotzky and Tim Paradis outlined some key strategies for effective networking in today's job market:</p>
        
        <div class="dos-donts">
            <div class="dos">
                <h4>Do:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Make sure your LinkedIn messages stand out. When it comes to online outreach, send a tailored message instead of a boilerplate one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it professional ‚Äî even online:</strong> Experts say maintaining professionalism on social media is key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dress for the industry:</strong> In-person schmoozing is back, and dressing the part is crucial. Each industry requires a slightly different look.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="donts">
                <h4>Don't:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wait until you need a job:</strong> A common mistake is that people often start networking only when they need a job. Maintaining relationships even when you're secure in a job matters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it all about you:</strong> Too many people only highlight their own experiences. Come up with questions ahead of time for the people you are meeting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask for too much:</strong> "You need to be very targeted and strategic about your ask, and you can probably only get away with asking them one thing," says Dorie Clark, a communication coach at Columbia Business School.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>The AI job hunting revolution</h3>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, some job seekers are finding success by embracing AI tools in their search. One BI reader recently shared how ChatGPT helped them land their dream job by crafting tailored resumes, cover letters, and even preparing for interviews :cite[2].</p>
        
        <p>"After years of working as a lawyer, embracing AI felt like venturing into foreign territory, but it also felt exciting," the job seeker wrote. "Through a lengthy dialogue with the AI, during which we discussed my strengths, interests, and professional goals, I was able to clarify exactly what I was looking for."</p>
        
        <h3>Other job market trends</h3>
        
        <p>Elsewhere in the job market:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Text scammers are preying on job market fears, with an uptick in fake job offers targeting desperate applicants :cite[1]</li>
            <li>Middle manager jobs are changing ‚Äî creating new opportunities for millennials and Gen Z :cite[1]</li>
            <li>The "Forward Deployed Software Engineer" role at Palantir has become key for producing startup founders, described as "founder preparation boot camp" :cite[1]</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As the job market continues to evolve, professionals will need to adapt their strategies ‚Äî combining traditional networking with new technological tools to stay competitive.</p>
